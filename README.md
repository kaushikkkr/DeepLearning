# DeepLearning
Deep learning codes to approach various problems, applying different DL concepts and gaining insights



1. DL_manual_modelling_ANN  - Realinsing an ANN network based on derived mathmetical equations, modeling the same and to observe its performance on a given data set.

2. ANN_Model_Keras - Realising an ANN model using the keras packages available and valuating its performance for a given dataset.

3. CNN_Cat_or_Dog - Realising a CNN model to predict if a given image is of a CAT or a DOG.

4. RNN_TCS_Stock_Predict - Realising an RNN model to predict the open price of TCS or any other company by scraping data from 
YAHOO finance.
